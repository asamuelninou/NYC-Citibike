# NYC-Citibike

## Overview
NYC has an excellent Citibike program! However, it can be recreated in Des Moines, Iowa. Even though the NYC Citibike program data might not apply to Des Moines, I will complete an analysis to present informed decisions for future investors. Our goal is to convince angel investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

### Statistical Analysis
To solidify the proposal, We will demonstrate the length of time that bikes are checked out, the number of bike trips taken by the day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user for each day of the week using Tableau.

## Analysis

### Gender Matters

Males were more than three times as likely to rent Citibikes and check out bikes for longer durations.

Males rented out bikes during peak times Monday-Friday than females.

### Time is of the Essence

The busiest times bikes rented in NYC were from 8 am-10 am and 5 pm to 7 pm.

## Summary
We discovered some interesting trends that we can investigate further in Des Moines. For example, our target market could be males who need transportation in the morning and evening. We need further analysis to determine how this insight applies to Des Moines. 

### Why Their?
![Gender by Location](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/92180070/216746881-a0d0d6fd-4418-4c81-bedd-e59c4b6a2d8f.png)
I would like to investigate particular locations that Citibikes are used the most. This information would lead me to answer the following questions:
1) Are users using bikes to get to and from work?
2) What other transportation resources are available, and why are Citibikes preferred for our audience?

### Bike Repairs by gender and location

1) To perform a risk analysis, it is important to determine which bikes need to be repaired. It would be interesting to determine which start and stop locations get used the most and determine if there are any hazards that we can get ahead of.
