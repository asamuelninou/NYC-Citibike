# NYC-Citibike

## Overview
NYC has an awesome Citibike program that I believe could recreated in Des Moines, Iowa. Even though the data of NYC Citibike program might not apply to Des Moines, we will complete analysis to make informed decisions for future investors of Des Moines Citibike program. Our goal is to convince angel investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

### Statistical Analysis

## Analysis
To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis. We will show the length of time that bikes are checked out, show the number of bike trips taken by the day of the week, and show the number of bike trips for each type of user for each day of the week.

### Gender Matters
